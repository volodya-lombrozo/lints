This Java package is a collection of "lints" (aka "checkers") for
[XMIR] (an intermediate representation of a
[EO] program). This is not about static analysis or code
formatting. This is about best practices and readiness of code
for successful compilation and execution.

We use this package as a dependency in the
[EO-to-Java compiler][EO]:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
  <artifactId>lints</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.26</version>
</dependency>
```

You can also use it in order to validate the validity
of [XMIR] documents your software may generate:

```java
import com.jcabi.xml.StrictXML;
import org.eolang.lints.Program;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

final class Foo {
  @Test
  void testValidProgram() {
    Assertions.assertTrue(
      new Program(
        new StrictXML("<program> your XMIR goes here </program>")
      ).defects().isEmpty()
    );
  }
}
```

Then, you can run a whole-program analysis of XMIR files
in your project, using the `Programs` class (there is a
different set of lints to be executed here!):

```java
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import org.eolang.lints.Programs;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

final class Foo {
    @Test
    void testSetOfPrograms() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(
            new Programs(
                Paths.get("xmir-files") // directory with XMIR files
            ).defects().isEmpty()
        );
    }
}
```

It is possible to disable any particular linter in a program,
with the help of the `+unlint` meta.

## Design of This Library

The library is designed as a set of lints, each of which
is a separate class implementing the `Lint` interface.
Each lint is responsible for checking one particular aspect
of the [XMIR] document. The `Program` class is responsible for  
running all lints and collecting defects for a single XMIR file.
The `Programs` class is responsible for running all lints and
collecting defects for a set of XMIR files. All in all,
there are only four classes and interfaces that are supposed to
be exposed to a user of the library:

* `Program` - checker of a single [XMIR]
* `Programs` - checker of a set of [XMIR]
* `Defect` - a single defect discovered
* `Severity` - a severity of a defect

There are also a few classes that implement `Iterable<Lint>`: 
`PkMono`, `PkWpa`, and `PkByXsl`.
They are supposed to be used only by the `Program` and `Programs`,
and are not supposed to be exposed to the user of the library.
They are responsible for providing a set of lints to be executed,
building them from the information in classpath.

## Benchmark

Here is the result of linting XMIRs:

<!-- benchmark_begin -->
```text
Input: com/sun/jna/Pointer.class
Size of .class: 22Kb (22Kb bytes)
Size of .xmir after disassemble: 1Mb (1Mb bytes, 29630 lines)
Lint time: 6s (5807 ms)

```

The results were calculated in [this GHA job][benchmark-gha]
on 2024-12-16 at 08:39,
on Linux with 4 CPUs.
