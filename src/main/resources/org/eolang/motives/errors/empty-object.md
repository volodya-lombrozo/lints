# Empty Object

Objects without any attributes: neither void nor attached are prohibited.

@todo #19:35min Document motives and examples for `empty-object` lint.
Currently, we don't have a test case for this `empty-object` lint.
We should create a new test case, and then document a motive with examples
for this lint.
