# Wrong `QQ.txt.sprintf` Arguments

The `QQ.txt.sprintf` object must have a match between its placeholder variables
and passed arguments.

Incorrect:

```eo
# App.
[] > app
QQ.io.stdout > @
not.sprintf
  "Hello, %s! Your account is %d."
  * name
```

Correct:

```eo
# App.
[] > app
QQ.io.stdout > @
not.sprintf
  "Hello, %s! Your account is %d."
  * name acc
```
